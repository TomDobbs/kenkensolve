A program for solving KenKen boards, popular puzzles involving numbers
and arithmetic (think Sudoku, but less tedious).

For examples of KenKen puzzles, visit www.kenken.com

This program was written by Nicholas Herson.  Feel free to modify and develop it
as you see fit, or maybe suggest an improvement by e-mailing (nicholas.herson@berkeley.edu).

Compatability:
    This code was developed on a Linux machine, but should work just fine across all 
    major operating systems with no issues.



USAGE:
    Open up a terminal, navigate to the KenKen solver's root, and use the following command:
        python kenken.py KENKEN_FILENAME.kk

    Puzzle layout files are best kept in the "puzzles" subdirectory, so the command should look more like:
        python kenken.py puzzles/KENKEN_FILENAME.kk
    
    (NOTE: it might be a backslash for Windows users)
