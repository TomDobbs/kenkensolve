First line: 
    Size of the board, should be an integer

Proceeding lines:
    One line for every constraint of the form:
        FUNC RESULT (x0, y0) (x1, y1) ..... (xn, yn)
    Where: 
        FUNC is in {add, sub, mul, div, con}
        RESULT is the desired result of performing FUNC on the coordinates listed
        (xn, yn)... is a list of non-diagonal adjacent coordinates involved in the constraint.
