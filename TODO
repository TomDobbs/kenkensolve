Features and Things to add or work on:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PARSING:
- Better separate the main() function and parsing procedures
- More thorough sanity checking and error handling for parsing prodedures
- Allow for comments in KenKen layout files
- Come up with an smarter way to layout KenKen files (they take FOREVER to type in)

SOLVING:
- Make arcConsistency run faster
    - I don't think every single (Coordinate, Constraint) pair needs to be 
        re-evaluated every time a coordinate assignment is made and the
        helper funciton recurses.  Put this code outside the "helper" function
        so it runs only once.
    - Least Constraining Variable?
- Add more solving methods
    - Backtracking only
    - The one where you assign everything at the start, and systematically fix it

OBJECT MANAGEMENT:
- Give Board its own .py file, just like Coordinate and Constraints
- Create custom Exceptions to throw for parsing, don't just use
    built-in ones inappropriately

INTERFACE:
- Create a front-end 
- Display results in an ASCII-generated board via the terminal

MISC
- Functionality to generate a random KenKen board
