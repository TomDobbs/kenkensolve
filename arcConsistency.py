    Takes in a board, and runs the arcConsistency technique to find a solution to the KenKen,
    if one exists.
    Steps:
    1. Throw every (Coordinate, Constraint) pair onto the consistencyQueue and check consistency
        for all values in the coordinate's domain
            - Eliminate values as necessary
    2. If a variable is pruned, take all Coordinates linked to the current Coordinate via a constraint,
        and put them into the queue (if they aren't already
    3. When the queue is empty:
        - Make sure all Coordinates still have domains of size >= 1
            - If not, backtrack (by throwing a NoSolution exception)
        - If all domains are size 1, we have a solution --> YAY!
        - If some domains are bigger than 1:
            - Find the smallest domain of size 2 or greater, and assign a value
                - Recurse and continue arcConsistency
